# Laboratory ERP System

A web-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed for academic laboratories to streamline member management, equipment usage, and financial control.

## Overview

Modern laboratories often lack a unified platform for daily operations such as attendance tracking, equipment reservation, and financial reimbursement. This project addresses that gap by providing a centralized Lab ERP system for professors and students. The platform improves operational efficiency and transparency, allowing members to access real-time information about their lab activities.

The system is developed using **C#** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend. It adopts object-oriented design principles and incorporates GRASP patterns, MVC architecture, and layered logic for maintainability and scalability.
